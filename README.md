International political geographies

Intent of this project is to reduce the complexity in ISO_3166-2 and provide code/data that may support that effort.

When submitting files, please use format:
- Country
ISO 3166-1 alpha-2
- Language
ISO 639-2

e.g. es_spa.csv

Maybe refined later to dialectal forms like eg. en_AU

Project is live so subject to change / refinement, submissions invited
